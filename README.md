# INSTALLATION

We need install this package to work with this repository, as you can see Protractor is not installed as Global Package as soon as we will install using our Package file inside the repository.
~~~~bash
$ npm install -g webdriver-manager      # Install Webdriver Manager
$ webdriver-manager update              # Updated Webdriver Manager
$ npm install -g typescript@2.3.4       # Install Typescript
~~~~

# START THE REPOSITORY

The first step is install all the repositories to run the project, just launch this command in the terminal been inside the root folder of the project.
~~~~bash
$ npm install
~~~~

# ASK FOR THE UTILS FOLDER

We need keep the security inside our repositories so please ask for the **utils** folder sending an email to kmshraj@gmail.com.

# RUN THE TESTS

Be sure that the VPN is connected and the spec that you want to run is define inside the line 17 for config.ts , e.g, specs: ['login/login-001.spec.js'] (the file should be the js no the ts file);

~~~~bash
$ webdriver-manager updated
$ webdriver-manager start
$ npm run test
~~~~

> I recomend create an aliase to run Webdriver-Manager:
> alias webdriver="webdriver-manager update && webdriver-manager start"
> Also you can create multiple aliase like:
> alias myNPMGlobals="npm list -g --depth=0"
> alias adcon4="cd GitLab/adcon4-automation/"

Also inside the package.json you will find more scripts with multiple options like enviroments urls, tsc generator, etc. to run them you need to write:

~~~~bash
$ npm run [scriptID] # e.g. npm run tsc
~~~~

## RUN SUITES

We can run packs of test cases predefined inside our config.ts file. If we want to run them we need run the next command line:

~~~~bash
$ webdriver-manager updated
$ webdriver-manager start
$ npm run suites [suiteID] # e.g. npm run suites LG
~~~~
